gnu-efi is a Git Submodule

My understanding is the latest upstream syslinux 6.0.4pre3 uses circa 2019:
Subproject commit d34132e62f666904158c7ec2f1eef5a9d5281c36

I last compiled the ACCRE syslinux 6.0.4pre1 with circa 2014:
Subproject commit ab54e2b40e914d0ca01dc3d44c8d4eb8517bf999


I think I will attempt a compile with circa 2023 gnu-efi....




Build:

"make clean" misses cleaning up a lot of files, and you will get confusing errors from old stale *.o files
Instead run "make spotless"

TL;DR:

make spotless
make all
make install INSTALLROOT=/where/you/want/your/syslinux/files/
